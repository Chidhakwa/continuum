# Continuum - A JavaScript Virtual Machine Built in JavaScript

Continuum is a JavaScript meta-interpeter that uses a bytecode virtual machine to host an ES6 ECMAScript runtime in ES3 and ES5 browsers and other JS engines (yes, ES6 in IE6 and 7). It is still a work in progress but it is fully usable right now.
